<h3>K Mean Cluster Algorithm :</h3>

<p>K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct groups or clusters. It aims to minimize the variance within each cluster while maximizing the variance between clusters. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to clusters based on the mean of the points and updates cluster centroids until convergence.</p>
<br>

<p>In K Mean Cluster, you iterate the mean untill get the proper distribution of clusters. On first iteration set k number of centroid chosen randomly and find distance between the centroid and value for all k centroid. And pick the small distance and put the value along that cluster by set the centroid as mean of the value and previous centroid. Done this for all the values in that iteration. On repeat the process on each iteration by set the centroid from previous iteration.</p>

<p>Formula for Distance : d =  âˆš(( x2 - x1 )^2 + ( y2 - y1 )^2 )</p>
